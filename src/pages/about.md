I'm Jethro May, a web developer from South Africa. I love writing code and i am lucky enough to do this as my job! I currently work for [__**PlusNarrative**__](https://plusnarrative.com/) primarily developing websites and applications using PHP and Laravel.
<br><br>
My goal for this website is to document and share what i learn throughout my career, creating a resource that other developers can use to learn the concepts i have become familiar with.
<br>    
When i'm not coding i enjoy playing music, travelling and keeping fit.
