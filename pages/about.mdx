# About

I am Jethro May, a web developer & writer from South Africa. I love writing code and I am lucky enough to do this as my job! I currently work for <a href="https://www.plusnarrative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">PlusNarrative</a>,
primarily developing websites using PHP. I have a strong passion for Laravel but I also work with React/Next.js and WordPress. 
                            
My goal for this website is to document and share what I learn throughout my career, creating a resource that other developers can use to learn the
concepts I have become familiar with. 

When i'm not coding i enjoy travelling and keeping fit.

## Setup

<ul className="list-disc mt-4 pl-4">
  <li>
    <p className="leading-normal underline">
        Macbook Pro (2014)
    </p>
    <p className="leading-normal">
        This is my main development machine which I use for majority of my work. I have no need for a desktop machine these days, I can work from anywhere.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p className="leading-normal">
        <a className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue500" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/index.html">PHPStorm</a>
    </p>
    <p className="leading-normal">
        Having used many IDE's over the years, nothing comes close to the sheer power of PHPStorm. I do however use VSCode for a few projects at work.
    </p>

    <li>
        <p className="leading-normal">
            <a className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead">Homestead</a>
        </p>
        <p className="leading-normal">
          While I could probably make use of Laravel Valet & Docker for Laravel development, I have used Homestead for quite some time and really enjoy working with it.
        </p>

    <li>
        <p className="leading-normal">
            <a className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
        </p>
        <p className="leading-normal">
            I currently use Docker for my WordPress projects, I tend to use the same structure for each project, so this allows me to quickly spin up and reuse the same environment.
        </p>
    </li>
  <li>
      <p className="leading-normal">
          <a className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="https://tableplus.com/">TablePlus</a>
      </p>
      <p className="leading-normal">
        Sequel Pro was my go-to database management tool for some time but when I tried out TablePlus I fell in love. It is extremely easy to use, visually appealing and the features are fantastic.
      </p>

    <p className="leading-normal">
        <a className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>
    </p>
    <p className="leading-normal">
        Nothing comes close to iTerm2, it is a personal favorite and one of the first things that gets installed when setting up a new machine.

          <a className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred 4 + Powerpack</a>
      </p>
      <p className="leading-normal">
       I only recently started using Alfred and it has been a game changer, I cannot imagine working without it.

          <a className="font-bold underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
      </p>
      <p className="leading-normal">
        Over the years I have used GitLab, Bitbucket and GitHub for various projects. These days all of my public and private repositories sit on GitHub.
